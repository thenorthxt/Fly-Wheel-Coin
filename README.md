What is FlyWheelCoin?

FlyWheelCoin is a Bitcoin-inspired memetic flywheel designed to roll value forward, not trap it in a single asset.

The core idea is simple:

A wheel doesn’t hold momentum.
It transfers it.

The FlyWheel Mechanism

FlyWheelCoin operates as a dual-compounding system:

Activity generates fees

Fees are split programmatically:

50% → FlyWheelCoin buybacks

50% → $Buttcoin accumulation

Buybacks reinforce FlyWheelCoin’s supply dynamics

Forward allocation compounds into the broader Bitcoin meme meta

Meta growth feeds attention back into the wheel

The system is designed to rotate, not stall.

Why This Works

Most memecoins try to absorb all value.

FlyWheelCoin does the opposite:

It reinforces itself

While simultaneously feeding a larger gravitational asset

This creates:

continuous rotation

aligned incentives

structural relevance inside the Bitcoin meme ecosystem
